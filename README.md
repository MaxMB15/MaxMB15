## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **software engineer and researcher** who loves figuring out how things work under the hood. I grew up in the Seattle area in a Dutch family, took every tech class I could, and never looked back.

- 🎓 **MSc Software Engineering** @ [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl) (Cum Laude, 8.2/10) · Thesis grade: 8.5/10  
- 🎓 **BSc Computer Science** (minor Physics) @ McGill University
- 💼 **~6 years** of industry + research experience  
- 📍 Currently based in **Amsterdam** · From Seattle → Montréal → Ottawa → Amsterdam   

I've worked on **build systems and tooling at scale** (Cisco), designed **programming languages and runtimes** (Rust, CL0), and built **exploratory programming environments** (IGC). I care about performance, clean architecture, and making tools that developers actually enjoy using.

When I’m not coding, I’m into **running**, **football**, **tennis**, **travel**, and **photography**.
